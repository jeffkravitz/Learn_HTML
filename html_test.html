    <h1>
        Hi, my name is jeff
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm learning how to code html.
    </p>
    <body>
        This website will serve the prupose of both testing my code and keeping my notes. The notation I 
        will be using is < content >, because I cannot write < and > into the code together
        without it being interpreted as html code (or at least I don't know how to do that yet).
    </body>
    <p>
        Here, I am experimenting with different text features. For example, 
        <em>
            here
        </em>
        I am using
        <em>
            italics.
        </em>
        I do this using the element < em >.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, I am using  
        <strong>
            bold text.
        </strong>
        I do this using the element < strong >.
    </p>
    <body>
        I also learned that the text displayed in the html is a body element. < head > describes meta 
        information about the site, such as the title, and provides links to scripts and stylesheets 
        the site needs to render and behave correctly.
    </body>
    <button>
        this is my button
    </button>
    <p>
        Create buttons using < button >.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <ls>
                Use < ul > to create unordered lists (bulltet point lists). I'm not sure that mine is 
                working properly.
            </ls>
            <ls>
                This should be a second bullet point
            </ls>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Create hyperlinks using < a href="https://jeffkravitz.github.io/Learn_R/Journal.html" > my R markdown website < /a >.
        <br>
            Here's a hyperlink to <a href="https://jeffkravitz.github.io/Learn_R/Journal.html">my R markdown website</a>.
        </br>
        Notice that inside the opening a tag there is href, which stands for "reference." This is called an attribute.

        Github commands for terminal:
        <ul>
            <ls>cd DIRECTORY_HERE - changes directory</ls>
            <ls>cd .. - moves to outer directory </ls>
            <ls>ls - lists files/folders in the current directory</ls>
            <ls>git clone URL_HERE</ls>
